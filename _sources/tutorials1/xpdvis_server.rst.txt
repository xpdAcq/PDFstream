Data Visualization Server
=========================

This server is used to start PyQt windows and plot images and curves on it. It receives the data from the proxy server and these data is published by the data processing server, marked by the prefix `an`.

The visualized data are the masked dark subtracted images, the I(Q), S(Q), F(Q), G(r) curves, and the QOI plots (currently only maximum peaks plots are shown but there will be more user customizable QOI plots in the future).
